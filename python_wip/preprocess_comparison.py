# CuPy Method: Uses CuPy for GPU-based operations. The image is uploaded to the GPU using CuPy, preprocessed (alpha channel removal, cropping, resizing, normalization), and the operation is timed.
# PyTorch Method: Uses PyTorch for GPU-based preprocessing, applying operations like cropping, resizing, and normalization using PyTorchâ€™s transformation pipeline.
# OpenCV with CUDA Method: Uses OpenCV's CUDA functionality. The image is uploaded to the GPU with cv2.cuda_GpuMat and operations like cropping, resizing, and normalizing are performed.
