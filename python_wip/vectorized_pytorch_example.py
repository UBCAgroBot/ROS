# Using PyTorch Tensors: The bounding boxes are converted to a PyTorch tensor, which allows for GPU acceleration and efficient batch processing.

# Vectorized Operations: All calculations (scaling and clipping) are performed using PyTorchâ€™s built-in functions, which are optimized for performance.

# Clamping: The torch.clamp function is used to ensure bounding box coordinates are within valid ranges, similar to np.clip.

# Condition Checks: The condition checks for bounding boxes being within the ROI are retained in the loop but could also be vectorized if needed. However, since it involves logic checks with conditions that might vary for each box, a loop is simpler here.
